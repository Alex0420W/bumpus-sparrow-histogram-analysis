# bumpus-sparrow-histogram-analysis
Histogram analysis of morphological selection in female house sparrows using Bumpus's classic 1898 dataset. Examines keel length distributions between survivors and casualties of a winter cold snap to identify selection patterns.

Female sparrows analysis:
Total females: 49
Died: 21 | Survived: 28

Keel length statistics:
Died - Mean: 0.8193, Range: 0.770 - 0.867
Survived - Mean: 0.8207, Range: 0.734 - 0.911
Verification - Total died: 21, Total survived: 28

Statistical Analysis:
T-test p-value: 0.9032
Mean difference (died - survived): -0.0014

Selection Analysis:
The histograms show the distribution of keel lengths in female sparrows.
Mean keel length:
- Died: 0.8193 inches
- Survived: 0.8207 inches
- Difference: 0.0014 inches

Conclusion:
Selection type: stabilizing
Explanation: Both groups have very similar mean values, suggesting intermediate keel lengths were favored.
